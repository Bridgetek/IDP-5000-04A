# IDP-5000-04A Board Support Package

## Introduction
This repository offers hardware support for the IDP-5000-04A platform. This BSP can function independently with a test application. A USB console is provided for diplaying debug information.

## Hardware Features
- FT903 32-bit RISC microcontroller (MCU) with 100MHz system clock
- FT813 graphics controller with display, touch and audio functionality
- 5-inch TFT LCD with capacitive touch
- Integrated buzzer for audio notifications
- Powered by a 9V-24VDC source vi an RJ45 port

## Software Features
The BSP is designed as a support package for devices. Sample usage can be found in *bsp_test.c*

1. The application calls the BSP’s ```init_bsp()```function to initialize interfaces and peripherals:
    - FT903 UART0 and USB console
    - SD card device driver & FATFS filesystem library
    - FT813 EVE GPU device drivers 

2. By default, debug information is transmitted via USB because ```ENABLE_USBDBG``` is set to one in *bsp_debug.h*. However, if ```ENABLE_USBDBG``` is disabled, the debug information will be sent through UART0 instead. 

3. To enable debug information in the eve_hal folder, set ```_DEBUG``` in *eclipse->properties->C/C++ General->Paths and Symbols->Symbols*

### Software requirement
This folder does not include the toolchain for FT903. For information on downloading, installing, and using the toolchain, please visit https://brtchip.com/ft9xx-toolchain/. This folder used toolchain setup can be found at https://brtchip.com/wp-content/uploads/Support/SoftwareExample/FT9xx/FT9xx_Toolchain_Setup_2.8.0_rc2.exe

### Build instruction
1. Install FT903 toolchain and download this folder

4. Setup building enviroment



> If '_DEBUG' is defined, the print information will be sent for eve_hal.

5. Build the project



6. The binary file will be in *[YOURPATH]\IDP-5000-04A\source\BSP\FT90x_Debug\BSP_IDP-5000-04A.bin*

7. Program the above binary onto the IDP-5000-04A development board (ensure the debug module is connected to the one-wire debug port as following).
